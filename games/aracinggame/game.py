# The "temporal car aura" is a way to record your actions during a game run. 
# It captures the sequence of game events (e.g., key presses) along with the corresponding game ticks (timestamps).
# This data allows you to replay your past run as a "ghost car."

# You get the "temporal car aura" as a list of tuples in the form [(tick, [pygame.event])]
# so for example:
#[(1, event(type = keydown, key = w)), (3,event(type = keyup, key = w), ...)]
#
#look here to learn more about pygame events and how you get type and key: https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/event.html
#Your task is to save this data to a file so it can be used later to recreate the ghost car's behavior. 
#Think about in which format you want to save the "aura" in a file
#Docstrings are also added for suggestions in collapsibles

    # Implement a feature to display a warning message whenever the car is reversing.
    #
    # Scenario:
    # - When the player presses the reverse key (`S`), a warning message should appear on the screen.
    # - The warning message should disappear as soon as the reverse key is released.
    #
    # Tasks:
    # 1. Detect when the reverse key (`S`) is pressed using `pressed_keys`.
    # 2. Create a warning message (e.g., "Warning: You are moving in reverse direction!") and render it on the screen.
    #
    # Provided Hints:
    # - Use the `pressed_keys` parameter to check the state of the `S` key (`pygame.K_s`).
    # - Use Pygame's `pygame.font.Font` or `pygame.font.SysFont` to render text dynamically.
    # - The message should only appear while the reverse key is actively pressed.
